Sharp IR

  Sample period 38.3ms +/- 9.6ms (assume varies with range?)
  Output delayed by 5ms from end of sample period, stable for next
  sample period

  With 1:1 gearing the maximum speed is around 400ms/rev.
  Speed control lacks resolution - hunts between two adjacent PWM
  settings which result in a ~10% speed change.

  Possible solutions
    Higher resolution servo control
    More timing slots in rotor
    Dither the servo control - switch mid resolution
